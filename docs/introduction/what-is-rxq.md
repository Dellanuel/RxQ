# What is RxQ?
**RxQ** is a JavaScript library that provides utilities to link [**RxJS**](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), a JavaScript implementation of Rx, with the Qlik Associative Engine (QAE). RxQ can be used to build complex, interactive solutions on top of QAE using the reactive programming paradigm.

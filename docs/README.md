# RxQ
**RxQ** is a JavaScript library that provides utilities to link [**RxJS**](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs), a JavaScript implementation of Rx, with the Qlik Associative Engine (QAE). RxQ can be used to build complex, interactive solutions on top of QAE using the reactive programming paradigm. The code repository can be found at [https://github.com/axisgroup/rxq](https://github.com/axisgroup/rxq). RxQ can be used in projects via npm like so:
```
$ npm install rxq
